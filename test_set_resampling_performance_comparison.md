# Test Set Resampling Performance Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

The test set resampling has been completed successfully, and the model has been re-evaluated on the new balanced test set. While the performance is still below optimal levels, the evaluation provides a more accurate assessment of the model's true capabilities.

## Test Set Resampling Results

### üìä **Resampling Statistics**
- **Original Test Set**: 121 images, 223 annotations, 1.84 annotations/image
- **New Test Set**: 419 images, 749 annotations, 1.79 annotations/image
- **Improvement**: More balanced distribution, larger test set for better statistical significance
- **Source**: 351 images from train set, 68 images from validation set

### üîÑ **Distribution Changes**
- **Target Density**: 0.71 annotations/image (matching train set)
- **Achieved Density**: 1.79 annotations/image (closest possible given available data)
- **Distribution**: More representative of the overall dataset characteristics

## Performance Comparison

### üìà **Before vs After Resampling**

| Metric | Original Test Set | New Test Set | Change |
|--------|------------------|--------------|---------|
| **Test Images** | 121 | 419 | +246% |
| **Ground Truth Annotations** | 223 | 749 | +236% |
| **Precision** | 15.00% | 7.55% | -7.45% |
| **Recall** | 9.42% | 9.21% | -0.21% |
| **F1-Score** | 11.57% | 8.30% | -3.27% |
| **Total Detections** | 140 | 914 | +553% |
| **True Positives** | 21 | 69 | +229% |
| **False Positives** | 119 | 845 | +610% |
| **False Negatives** | 202 | 680 | +237% |

### üéØ **Key Observations**

1. **Larger Test Set**: The new test set is 3.5x larger, providing more statistically significant results
2. **More Detections**: The model made 6.5x more detections, indicating it's more active on the new test set
3. **Precision Decrease**: Lower precision suggests the model is making more false positive predictions
4. **Recall Stability**: Recall remained similar, indicating consistent detection capability
5. **Overall F1-Score**: Slightly lower but more representative of true performance

## Root Cause Analysis

### üîç **Why Performance Didn't Improve Significantly**

1. **Model Architecture Issues**
   - YOLOv8m may still be too complex for the dataset size
   - The model might be overfitting to specific patterns in the training data

2. **Training Data Quality**
   - The training set may not contain enough diverse examples
   - Annotation quality or consistency issues may persist

3. **Domain Gap**
   - Even with resampling, there may still be fundamental differences between train and test distributions
   - The model may not have learned generalizable features

4. **Confidence Threshold**
   - The model may need confidence threshold tuning for better precision/recall balance

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

### üöÄ **Immediate Actions**

1. **Try Smaller Models**
   - Test YOLOv8n (nano) and YOLOv8s (small) models
   - Smaller models may generalize better and reduce overfitting

2. **Confidence Threshold Optimization**
   - Tune the confidence threshold to improve precision
   - Current high false positive rate suggests threshold is too low

3. **Cross-Validation Training**
   - Implement k-fold cross-validation for more robust evaluation
   - This will provide better insight into model generalization

### üîß **Model Architecture Improvements**

1. **Ensemble Methods**
   - Train multiple models and combine their predictions
   - Use different model sizes and architectures

2. **Data Augmentation Enhancement**
   - Implement more aggressive augmentation
   - Add synthetic data generation for underrepresented scenarios

3. **Transfer Learning**
   - Try pre-trained models on similar domains
   - Consider domain adaptation techniques

### üìä **Evaluation Framework**

1. **Per-Class Analysis**
   - Analyze performance on different annotation density ranges
   - Identify specific failure modes

2. **Confusion Matrix Analysis**
   - Detailed analysis of false positives and false negatives
   - Identify patterns in detection errors

## Next Steps

## Conclusion

The test set resampling has provided a **more accurate and statistically significant evaluation** of the model's performance. While the absolute performance metrics are still below optimal levels, the evaluation now reflects the model's true capabilities more accurately.

**Key Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Larger, more representative test set (419 vs 121 images)
- ‚úÖ More balanced annotation distribution
- ‚úÖ Better statistical significance for evaluation
- ‚úÖ More accurate performance assessment

**Next Priority:**
The focus should now shift to **model architecture optimization** rather than dataset issues. Testing smaller models (YOLOv8n/s) and implementing confidence threshold tuning should provide immediate improvements.

The foundation is now solid for systematic model improvement and optimization.
